The Sacramento Bee has filed suit opposing it. We\'ll get an update from the Sac Bee\'s Ed Fletcher.\n\nIllegal or Unauthorized? - The General Commission on Religion and Race of The United Methodist Church joined a national campaign to eliminate the use of the word "illegal" as part of the conversation on immigration reform. The UMC is working for passage of the DREAM Act.  Why is the church doing this? And why does it matter?\n\nHall of Fame - The 2010 California Hall of Fame Red Carpet and Induction Ceremony will be broadcast live for the first time tonight with co-hosts Lisa Ling, special Oprah correspondent, and Jason Kennedy, E! News correspondent. The inductees include Betty White, Wayne Thiebaud, Serena Williams, Mark Zuckerberg, Barbara Streisand and many more. The Hall of Fame has been a personal project of First Lady Maria Shriver, so what\'s going to happen to it now that her husband will no longer be governor of California? We\'ll talk with California Museum Executive Director Claudia French about it.\n\nDan Hicks - Dan Hicks and the Hot Licks are performing Friday, Dec. 17th at The Center for the Arts in Grass Valley. The band has a new Christmas album, "Crazy for Christmas." We\'ll hear some music.</description>\n  <date>2010-12-14</date>\n  <year>2010</year>\n  <subject>Capital Public Radio; KXJZ; Sacramento public radio; Ed Fletcher; Roseville, Galleria fire; gag order; Placer County District Attorney; Sacramento Bee; suit; Illegal; Unauthorized; General Commission on Religion and Race, the; United Methodist Church, the; national campaign; immigration refrorm; UMC; DREAM Act; Hall of Fame; California Hall of Fame Red Carpet; Induction Ceremony; broadcast live; first time; Lisa Ling; special Oprah correspondent; Jason Kennedy; E!
